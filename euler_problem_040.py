# Project Euler - Problem 40: Integer right triangles
#
# An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the 
# positive integers:
#
# 0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
#
# It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.
#
# If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the 
# value of the following expression.
#
# d_1 × d_10 × d_100 × d_1000 × d_10000 × d_100000 × d_1000000
